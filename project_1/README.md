### Project Aim

**Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD)** is a non-profit organization offering food, shelter and other services necessary for people in need of those aids. This project is designed to bring meaningful insights from the supply data gathered since around 1990's which is almost since the foundation of this organization (1983). The main topics would be the trend of the services given by year and season which will help the organization to predict service and products in higher demand in following years or seasons. 

### Data

Data was provided from the UMD organization which contains a collection of data with 79838 observations from 1990's to current year 2019. The data includes variables including: Client File Number, Client File Merge, Bus Tickets (Number of), Notes of Service, Food Provided for, Food Pounds, Clothing Items, Diapers, School Kits, Hygiene Kits, Referrals, and Financial Support.

### Questions of Interest

- Are there specific service/goods in higher demand recently?
- Are there specific trends in higher demand in certain seasons?
- Are there any trends in young children in need of help?
- Are there higher demand of support from the organization than before? Should the organization be prepared for more budget in order to support the future demands?

*The questions are subject to be changed if data is insufficient to deliver them. Also, more questions may be added if interesting insights are found during data exploration.*
