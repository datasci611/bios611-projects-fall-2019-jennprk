### Project Aim

**Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD)** is the organization that provides food, clothing, shelter and supportive services to our neighbors in need. They have been serving communities around in order to carry out this mission while providing a welcoming, caring and compassionate environment that affirms the dignity of our guests, volunteers and staff.

UMD was developed and is partially supported by a diverse group: many individuals, foundations, corporations, and government. In particular, their main services include food, shelter, clothing and supportive services for over 6,000 men, women and children annually.

This project aims to help the Urban Ministires of Durham (UMD) to have better understanding of the organization's operation by being able to check trends of their service/goods provided. This project will be based on the questions answered from the previous project (Project 1). 

By utilizing Shiny dashboard, it will enable UMD to interactively see the results of their interest based on the questions stated below. 

### Data

This project will be using the same data as the previous project, which was provided from the UMD organization itself containing a collection of data with 79838 observations from 1990's to current year 2019. The data includes variables including: Client File Number, Client File Merge, Bus Tickets (Number of), Notes of Service, Food Provided for, Food Pounds, Clothing Items, Diapers, School Kits, Hygiene Kits, Referrals, and Financial Support.

### Questions of Interest

1. How many years do clients visit?
2. Are there specific service/goods in higher demand recently?
3. Are there specific trends in higher demand in certain seasons?
4. Are there higher demand of support from the organization than before? Should the organization be prepared for more budget in order to support the future demands?
