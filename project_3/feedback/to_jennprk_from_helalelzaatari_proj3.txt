1) No as there was no Make file. It is ok as this is just a draft.

2) Yes the project used both python and the panda package as well as R with tidyverse.

3) No there was no docker file. But it is ok as this is just a draft.

4) There were no graphs. The author only transfered the wrangled data from python.
Plots should be added but it was clear from the README what plots the author wanted to have.

5)The project is very well organized.

6)Yes the purpose was clearly communicated in the README. The author wanted to know
the distribution of clients by race, age groups, gender and race. As well as
the income and non-cash support change from exit and whether there was any improvments.

7)Yes all of the questions posed in the README will help better serve the client.

8)Yes it was included in the background part of the README.

9)There were no figures coded. But from the README after the distribution of clients by race,
age groups etc... is coded the interpretations will be straight forward.

10)In the python code, the purpose of every chunck of code was explained and clearly communicated.
There was not a lot of R code.

11) Once the analysis is done and graphs/ plots are coded the take-home messages will be clear and thus
should be added in the README or Rcode.
